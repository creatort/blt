blt: basic little tab (basic, it's basic)

it's not actually a sandwich though

how to install: https://www.lifewire.com/crx-file-2620391
i'm a bit lazy to write it out but it's all on there
adding it might just give you an error because it's not on the webstore and i'm lazy and won't pay 5 usd for that
if it does that, download the source and load it as unpacked

stick any problems into the issues tab <3
