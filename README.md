## ☘️ blt: basic little tab (basic, it's basic)

it's not actually a sandwich though  

how to install: https://www.lifewire.com/crx-file-2620391  
i'm a bit lazy to write it out but it's all on there  
adding it might just give you an error because it's not on the webstore and i'm lazy and won't pay 5 usd for that  
if it does that, download the source and load it as unpacked  

stick any problems into the issues tab <3
